## READING DATA

Since my data warehouse is built on PostgreSQL, I opted to load the data using Python. I utilized a Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and performed a complete load of all files from the CRM and ERP directories. 

You can find the notebook used for this process [here](../scripts/bronze/Load.ipynb).
